Hello,

My name is Alexandre Gazagnes, I am a 30 years old french man, living in Paris. 

After a perparatory class in maths and ecnomics, I graduated a french Business school in HR, IT and Entreprenership. I started my worklife in 2009, i the meiddle of the biggest economics crisis since 1930.
I was afraid of not finding a job and and tha'ts why i started my carrer by finding jobs for the others. I first vwas an "headhunter" trying to find the name and coorodintaes of specific executives workers in companies. My job was to find tem, to cotacte them and to have them cndidating on sepcifics jobs. My first job was very interesing and i loved it.
 I wanted to evoluate and to become the guy whos in charge not only of the resaearch but the whole recruitment porocess. I integrated a major of execuitive rercuitment  company known as michael page and i beacme a consulant before evoluating as a senior. 
 
 I spent 3 or 4 years looking for clients, negociating, and managing complete rercuitement porcess. I was still in charge of finding new caniates, and my former job was very helpfful. An important piece of information is that i was specialiezs in A sector : Property and consurcion. I was indeed specialised in Architecture, Consil, PMO, and Ingeneering (HVAC, structure, mechanical and electrical, enviroement, quantity srverillors. recruiting for these profiles was as difficult as finding Java JEE specialis, or data scientist or Articuralinformaticiens, so very very  hard. 
 
 But it was very interesting...
